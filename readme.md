# Foam

**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to your new Foam Knowledge Base!**

## Getting started

This documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/macOS/Windows machine.

1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.
2. Press "Use this template" button at [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.
3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.

    *Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item.*

4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)

After setting up the repository, head to [[getting-started]] to get familiar with your new knowledge base!

To learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.

And remember that you can always join our [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g)!

## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (Markdown documents) to get you started.

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [[getting-started]] - learn how to use your Foam workspace
- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do

In the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.
