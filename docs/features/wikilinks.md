# Wikilinks

Wikilinks are the internal links that connect the files in your knowledge base.

To create a wikilink use `[[` and type the name of another file in your repo, for example [[graph-visualization]]

You can also create a [[placeholder]].
A placeholder is a wikilink that doesn't have a target file and a link to a placeholder is styled differently so you can easily tell them apart.
They can still be helpful to highlight connections.

Open the graph with `Foam: Show Graph` command, and look at the placeholder node.

Remember, with `CTRL/CMD+click` on a wikilink you can navigate to the note, or create it (if the link is a placeholder).
