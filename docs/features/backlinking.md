# Backlinking

When using [[wikilinks]], you can find all notes that link to a specific note in the **Backlinks Explorer**

- Run `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` for Windows), type "backlinks" and run the **Explorer: Focus on Backlinks** view.
- Keep this pane always visible to discover relationships between your thoughts
- You can drag the backlinks pane to a different section in VS Code if you prefer. See: [[make-backlinks-more-prominent]]
- Finding backlinks in published Foam workspaces via [[materialized-backlinks]] is on the [[roadmap]] but not yet implemented.
