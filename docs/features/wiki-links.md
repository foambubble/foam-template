# Wiki Links

Wiki links are the internal links that connect the files in your knowledge base.

To create a wiki link use `[[` and type the name of another file in your repo, for example [[graph-visualization]]

You can also create a [[placeholder]].
A placeholder is a wiki link that doesn't have a target file.
They can still be helpful to highlight connections.
Open the graph with `Foam: Show Graph` command, and look at the placeholder node.

[graph-visualization]: graph-visualization.md "Graph Visualization"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
