# Publish to GitHub

The standard [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) is ready to be published to GitHub, and GitHub pages.

## Enable navigation in GitHub

To allow navigation from within the GitHub repo, make sure to generate the link references, by setting

- `Foam › Edit: Link Reference Definitions` -> `withExtensions`

See [[link-reference-definitions]] for more information.

## Customising the style

You can edit `assets/css/style.scss` to change how published pages look.
