# Add images to your notes

This #recipe allows you to paste images on to your notes.

VScode (since
[1.79](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_79#_copy-external-media-files-into-workspace-on-drop-or-paste-for-markdown))
now has the ability to paste images from the clipboard, or drag-and-drop image
files, directly into markdown documents. The file will be created in the
workspace, and a link generated in Markdown format. 

VSCode settings under `Markdown > Copy Files` and `Markdown > Editor > Drop` can
be used to configure where the files get placed in your workspace, how they're
named, how conflicts with existing files are handled, and more.
